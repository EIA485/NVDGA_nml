# NVDGA for nml

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that literally adjusts your Graphics settings in NEOS VR dynamically based on your framerate. It takes a couple of samples of your framerate every few seconds and adjusts automatically based on that.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [NVDGA.dll](https://github.com/eia485/NVDGA_nml/releases/latest/download/NVDGA.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
